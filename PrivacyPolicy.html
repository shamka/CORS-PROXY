<strong>Privacy Policy</strong> <p>
     Muslim jamaat built the CORS Proxy app as
    an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by
     Muslim jamaat at no cost and is intended for use as
    is.
  </p> <p>
    This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
    policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
    Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
  </p> <p>
    If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
    the collection and use of information in relation to this
    policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
    used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
    anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
  </p> <p>
    The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
    as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at
    CORS Proxy unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
  </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
    The application does not collect or store any personal information.
  </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
    Roughly speaking, the application allows you to bypass the limitations of CORS, and this is the only functionality of this application. Therefore, you take full responsibility for the violation of your security in case of circumvention of CORS protection. For our part, we have limited the transmission of headers such as cookies and set-cookies(2) to avoid abuse of our application. The application only works on the local host and will not be able to act as a proxy server for other devices.
  </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
    This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on
    a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
    that these external sites are not operated by me.
    Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
    Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
    no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
    privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or
    services.
  </p> <p><strong>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</strong></p> <!----> <div><p>
      I do not knowingly collect personally
      identifiable information from children. I 
      encourage all children to never submit any personally
      identifiable information through 
      the Application and/or Services.
      I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor 
      their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing 
      their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child 
      has provided personally identifiable information to us through the Application and/or Services, 
      please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing 
      of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent 
      or guardian to do so on your behalf).
    </p></div> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
    I may update our Privacy Policy from
    time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
    periodically for any changes. I will
    notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
    this page.
  </p> <p>This policy is effective as of 2024-01-08</p> <p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p> <p>
    If you have any questions or suggestions about my
    Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact me at corsproxy.app@sh16.ru.
